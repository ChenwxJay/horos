#	I want to develop a small os just for study and for fun.                 #
#	The name of this samll os is combination of horse and os, for I hope     #
#	horos can run quickly like a horse. So if I will choose a masot for      #
#	it, the horse will be preference.                                        #
#	I develop horse on a i386 machine so it  will be expected to run on      #
#	x86 only. But in the future, I hope horos can run on embeded device,     #
#	for I think IOT will a useful future technology.                         #
#	If you are instresting with it, joining me!                              #
